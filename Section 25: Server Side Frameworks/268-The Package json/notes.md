# package.json File Notes

All NPM packages contain a package.json file in the root folder of the package. 

The file contains all the metadata for the package. It also contains the dependencies for the package.

`npm install {PACKAGE} --save` will download the package and add it to the dependencies section of our package.json file. 

Using `npm init` will walk you through creating a package.json file for your app. You walk through the steps filling out the information and the json file is created.
