    <h1>This is my first tag!!!</h1>
    <h2>This is my second tag!!!</h2>
    <h3>This is my third tag!!!</h3>

    <p>This is a <strong>first paragraph.</strong> Notice how the paragraph will
        end soon due to the use of the "p" tags.
    </p>

    <p>Now the <em>second paragraph</em> has started. By starting with the "p"
    tage, this second set of text can take place seperate from the paragraph above.
    It's important to use tages like this to organize your documents in a clean fashion.
    </p>

    <p>Remember, when writting HTML5 code, your structer and style need to be
        seperate. By this, structer tages use the traditional simple abbreviations like "p" for
        creating paragraphs. However, when you want to put text in <strong>BOLD</strong>,
        or, maybe want to set text in <em>italics</em>, don't use the tradition "b" for bold or
        "i" for italics. Use the new versions like "strong" for bold or "em" for italics (em is short for
        emphasize). These more discriptive versions help keep the code <strong><em>CLEAN</em></strong> by seperating the
        structer tags from the style tags, an important skill to have when people need to <strong>read your code!</strong>
