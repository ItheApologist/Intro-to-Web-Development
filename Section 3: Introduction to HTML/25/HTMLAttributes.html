<h1>Do you still love meeeeeeeee</h1>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTv-UYQIbYgnXb1tT-8bE0fCFotPWisdsu9hV9ApxM3Dd_tcvuf&s"> 
<p>Above we have a simple reference to an image online of a character from the movie Midsommar, a favorite of mine. I picked the
    most unsusal image to keep people guessing. It's good to note that "img" is a self closing tag, meaning that the whole thing is still wrapped
    with the "<>" characters. However, it does not need a closing "/img" tag.

<a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dancing-tim-and-eric-tayne-g52qWob95XWFi/fullscreen">Click me to DANCE</a>
<p>The above code is an "a" tag, meaning an anchor tag. This tag is used to create hyperlink references to various content.
    In the above example, I've created a link to a fun GIF using the "a" tag along with the "href" attribute. This attribute is written with in the 
    inital a tag, followed by an "=", followed by the link to the content in quotes, folloed by the cosing ">". Proceeding that, the link text is inserted between
    the opening and closing tag. It would look like so "a href=LINK>LINK TEXT/a. Note that I have to leave out the "<>" characters, otherwise HTML
    will read it as a tag. The "a" tag does need a closing tag as well.

<a href="page2.html">Go to the second page!</a>
<p>In the above code, we created a second HTML page that lives locally in the same directory as our inital HTML page. By simply writing out the file
    name in the href, our link will open that page when clicked on!
