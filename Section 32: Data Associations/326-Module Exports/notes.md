# Module.exports Notes

We can brake down our code into multiple files and then import those files and code into our main app js file. This is called making our code modular. We do this because it allows our code to be more flexible. We can reuse our code more easily in our app and it keeps the code looking clean.

`module.exports` is the code used to export our code results for import into another js file.
