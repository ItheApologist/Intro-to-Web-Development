# Intro to Data Associations Notes

Associations allow us to have multiple collections in our database that are related to each other. In the example of our YelpCamp app, we will be associating users with blog post.

There are three main types of data association relationships: One to One, One to Many, and Many to Many.

One to One relationships are when one entity has a single association to another entity. 

One to many relationships are when one entity has associations to many other entities.

Many to many relationships are when many entities have associations to many other entities.
