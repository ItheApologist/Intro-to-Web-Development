    <h1>Login</h1>
    
    <input type="text" placeholder="username">
    <input type="password" placeholder="password">
    <button>Submit</button>
    
    <p>The above code was taken from our last example. Individually, the elements
        of a form can be created. However, unless they are incased in a form tag, they
        won't be able to do anything with the data that is submitted. Note that when the
        code above is filled out and Submit is clicked, nothing happens. When this is done
        to the code below, you can see the page is refreshed. This is because the code below
        is encased in the form tag 
    </p>
    
    <form>    
        <input type="text" placeholder="username">
        <input type="password" placeholder="password">
        <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
    
    <p>The only thing the second form does is refresh the page. Remember, we have two items
        that need to be specified for a form to work: The action and the method. The action is 
        where the form data is sent to and the method is a get/post. By default, if no action is 
        specified, it will be sent to its own location. If a method isn't specified, it will use 
        get to pull the data. Hence why the page refreshes. It first sends the data to the same location.
        This HTML page has nothing to store that data, so nothing happens. Then a get is called that pulls the 
        page again, causing a refresh.
    </p>

    <p>The code below is the same. However, an action and method are called. In the below example,
        the action is set to wikipedia.com while the method is set to get. This will cause Wikipedia to 
        load when the user data is submitted.

    <form>    
        <input type="text" placeholder="username">
        <input type="password" placeholder="password">
        <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
