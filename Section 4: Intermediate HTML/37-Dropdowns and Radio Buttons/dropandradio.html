    <h1>New User Input Types</h1>

    <p>This example will cover three additional types of user inputs: radio buttons, select tags, textarea tags.</p>
    
    <p>
        Below is an input type of "radio". Next to it is an input of type "checkbox" so you can 
        view the difference. The major difference is that a radio tag cannot be turned off. As 
        well, the radio button only allows for one choice at a time. In contrast, checkboxes allow the user to check 
        off as many or little (including none) choices as they would like.
    </p>

    <input type="radio">
    <input type="checkbox">

    <p>
        The below example contains a simpole questionair asking if you prefer cats or dogs. Obviously
        any sane person would chose cats, but we won't get into that now. What's important is that we have
        set up a radio button for each answer. Despite that, the user can select both making it all but useless
        at the moment.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Do you prefer cats or dogs?</h3>
    
    <form>
        <label for="dogs">Dogs:</label>
        <input id="dogs" type="radio">

        <label for="cats">Cats:</label>
        <input id="cats" type="radio">

        
    </form>

    <p>
        To make the form below force only one possible selection, we use the name
        attribute. By selecting a name and setting the same name for both input tags,
        we force only one selection to be possilbe. Check the source page for the example.
    </p>

    <form>
        <label for="dogs">Dogs:</label>
        <input name="petChoice" id="dogs" type="radio">

        <label for="cats">Cats:</label>
        <input name="petChoice" id="cats" type="radio">

        
    </form>
    
    <p>
        In the form below, we have added a button at the end of the form with the 
        buttom tag. Normally we create buttons with the input tag. However, when using a 
        button tag at the end of a form, we cause that button to become the one to submit
        the data. Now when you submit your choice below (Make sure it is Cats!), notice
        that the URL adds the resulting name of the input followed by "=on". This is not
        the result we want but test below just to see.
    </p>
    
    <form>
        <label for="dogs">Dogs:</label>
        <input name="petChoice" id="dogs" type="radio">

        <label for="cats">Cats:</label>
        <input name="petChoice" id="cats" type="radio">

        <button>Go!</button>
        
    </form>

    <p>
        To add the correct data to be sent, we need to add a value attribute to the tags.
        Now notice that the form below submits the data value of the same name as the choice
        chosen below! See the source page for the example.
    </p>
    
    <form>
        <label for="dogs">Dogs:</label>
        <input name="petChoice" id="dogs" type="radio" value="Dogs">

        <label for="cats">Cats:</label>
        <input name="petChoice" id="cats" type="radio" value="Cats">

        <button>Go!</button>
        
    </form>

    <p>
        The next item we are going to explore is the select tag. You can see below the 
        tag in action. We don't have any user data in yet, so when clicked, nothing happens. 
    </p>

    <select>
       
    </select>
    
    <p>
        To add in selections, you need to specify items with the "option" tag. 
        Between the tag you put the name of the content you wish to add. Below we
        have a simple question with three options to select. Notice that when we hit 
        the go button, we don't get anything in the HTML.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What is your favorite color?</h3>

    <form>
    
        <select>
            <option>Red</option>
            <option>Orange</option>
            <option>Blue</option>
        </select>
        
        <button>Go!</button>
        
    </form>

    <p>
        To send the data, we need to add a name to the select tag. Below we've added the name
        color, which will populate the HTML with color=CHOICE. See the source page for example.
    </p>

    <h3>What is your favorite color?</h3>
    
    <form>
    
        <select name="Color">
            <option>Red</option>
            <option>Orange</option>
            <option>Blue</option>
        </select>
        
        <button>Go!</button>

    </form>

    <p>
        Sometimes we want different data from inputs when being submitted. Below we have a question
        about a user's mood. Notice the data that is submitted with the input. Not very useful.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What is your mood?</h3>
    
    <form>
    
        <select name="Mood">
            <option>:)</option>
            <option>:|</option>
            <option>:(</option>
        </select>
        
        <button>Go!</button>

    </form>

    <p>To change the data being sent, we will add the value tag. In the example below, instead of the
        raw data from the emoticons being sent, we will send the verbal words assicated with them: happy, neutral, and sad.
        See the source page for the code example. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>What is your mood?</h3>
    
    <form>
    
        <select name="Mood">
            <option value="happy">:)</option>
            <option value="neutral">:|</option>
            <option value="sad">:(</option>
        </select>
        
        <button>Go!</button>

    </form>

    <p>
        When we need to create a text input box large enough for big sums of data, we 
        use the "textarea" tag. See the example below.
    </p>
    
    <textarea></textarea>

    <p>
        This own it's own isn't useful. However, with the rows and cols attributes, we
        can set numarical values that define the size of our textarea. The example below
        has a rows value of 10 and cols value of 50. Notice that we have a much larger text box for
        use. Remember to set a name for your textarea so that the data is sent properly.
    </p>

    <form>
        
        <textarea name="paragraph" rows="10" cols="50"></textarea>
        <button>Go!</button>
        
    </form>
