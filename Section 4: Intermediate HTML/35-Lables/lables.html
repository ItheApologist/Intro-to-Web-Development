    <h1>Lables in Fourms</h1>

    <p>Lables allow us to add captions to our fields in our fourms. Not only does
        this inform the regular user as to what each fourm field is requesting, this
        is also very important for visually impared usres. Assistance software looks
        for these lables when reading back to the user.
    </p>

    <p>Below we see the same fourm we have been making. We have added label tags in order to
        add those captions to our fourm. All imputs are placed within the label tag in order to
        add the caption. See the source page for the code example.
