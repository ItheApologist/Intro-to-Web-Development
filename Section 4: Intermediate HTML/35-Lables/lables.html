    <h1>Labels in Forms</h1>

    <p>Labels allow us to add captions to our fields in our forms. Not only does
        this inform the regular user as to what each form field is requesting, this
        is also very important for visually impaired users. Assistance software looks
        for these labels when reading back to the user.
    </p>

    <p>Below we see the same form we have been making. We have added label tags in order to
        add those captions to our form. All inputs are placed within the label tag in order to
        add the caption. See the source page for the code example.
    </p>

    <form action="https://wikipedia.com">

        <label>
            Username:
            <input type="text" placeholder="username">
        </label>

        <label>
            Password:
            <input type="password" placeholder="password">
        </label>

        <input type="submit">
        
    </form>

    <p>Another method of using labels is to use a "for" attribute that corresponds to an "id"
        attribute used in the input tag. This means that our input tags no longer need to be contained
        within our input tags. View the source page to see the difference. However, the below
        form is the same as the one above. 
    </p>

    <form action="https://wikipedia.com">
        
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username">
        
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input id="password" type="text" placeholder="password">
    </form>
    
</body>
