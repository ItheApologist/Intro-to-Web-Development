    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Below is our HTML structure we are going to style.</p>

    <h4>My Hobbies:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Playing Guitar</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Origami</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>There are two ways to create style in HTML. The first one, Inline, is not the way to go.
        This was the old method used to style HTML before CSS came about. Below we have our code
        styled via Inline. Check the source page for the code example.
    </p>
    
    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Below is our HTML structure we are going to style.</p>

    <h4>My Hobbies:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li style="color: purple">Playing Guitar</li>
        <li style="color: purple">Cooking</li>
        <li style="color: purple">Origami</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One issue with the above example is that you have to place the styling for each tag, making work
        cumbersome. The other issue with this is that all the code, both the HTML structure and the styling, 
        will be contained within the same file. This again makes work cumbersome opposed to using two files to separate
        both structure and styling. 
    </p>

    <p>The second method of styling is to use style tags. You will notice on our page that both h1 headers are purple.
        However, if you look at the code, you won't see any styling in the h1 tags. That's because we used the Style Tag method
        to create the styling. To do this, we insert the style tag into the HTML header. We call the type as text/css, then write the
        CSS syntax to call all h1 headers to be purple. Check the source page for the example. I've also put in an li styling
        using this method resulting in all unstyled li tags (meaning they don't have any specified styling in them) to turn orange.
    </p>

    <p>One thing we have been doing wrong thus far has been to write our CSS in the same file as our HTML. By doing so, 
        we are not following the methodology of keeping our structure and styling separate. To resolve this, we can use a link tag
        in the HTML header that references our local HTML file. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

    <p>You might have noticed that our paragraphs have all been blue! Also, our h2 tag above is green. This was done doing the link
        method. If you look at the source page, you can see in the header we have a link tag referencing our styleSheet.css page. You
        can even click the link to view the CSS file.
