To install packages, you run npm install {PACKAGE NAME}. This will install the package in the current directory under a folder called node_modules.

To use a package, you define a variable equal to require("{PACKAGE NAME}"). 

See our code for the examples. Running node app.js will display a cat and also give us a knock knock joke.
