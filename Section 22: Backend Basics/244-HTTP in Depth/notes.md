# HTTP in Depth Notes

There are many different types of request that can be made to a web server.

The most common is the GET request. This request ask for the information supplied to a web server. When you type in https://google.com, you make a GET request for the homepage of Google. 

This is also the case for most search functionality. If you search for something on a websites built-in search feature, you will notice the URL change to include the data you entered. This is known as a query string. This is how data can be sent with a GET request without needing to modify anything.
