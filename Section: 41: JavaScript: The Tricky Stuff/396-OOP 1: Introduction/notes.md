# Object Oriented Programming Notes

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming model based around the idea of objects and blueprints that create objects. These blueprints are called "classes". Classes are made abstract and modular in order for easy reuse in an application.

These classes, also known as constructor functions, are always capitalized by convention.

The arguments keyword is one that allows you to pass in an unspecified number of array arguments when using the apply keyword. So, instead of typing out all the arguments into an array, you would just type:

`functionName.apply(this, arguments);`
